Connecting to LiquidMS
======================

Using LiquidMS in-game
----------------------

To connect to a LiquidMS node in-game, set
`Options > Server Options > Advanced > Master Server` to
`http://<YOUR NODE'S HOSTNAME/v1`. Now you should be
able to use that node like a regular master server.

**NOTE:** The URL must not end in a slash as the game is not trailing
          slash-aware when doing HTTP requests.

**NOTE:** In case you're connecting to a local development node, the game
          has been reported to have difficulties around the local DNS name
          `localhost`.


Once you open the server browser, you will notice that there's no way to
query "all" rooms. LiquidMS has divided all rooms into two rooms/categories:

The room *Universe* is defined as all servers stored within a LiquidMS
node's corresponding database, both internal and remote fetched.

The room *World* is defined as all servers uniquely registered to the
database and it's responses will be automatically generated by LiquidMS.
In order to host local rooms


Using the server browser
------------------------

When hosted, the server browser can easily be reached through `http://<node
hostname>/liquidms/browse`. When correct, you'll be greeted by a
blue-yellow screen with a LiquidMS logo. This is the server browser.

Well... one of them: Depending on who you're connecting to, your LiquidMS
provider may offer you either one of the [fast] or [fancy] browsers.

[fast]: ../teardown/fastbrowser.md
[fancy]: ../teardown/fancybrowser.md

The *fast* browser will simply present you with a table and a search bar.
You can click on the table's header fields to order your netgames or you
can enter text into the search bar to filter for certain servers.

**NOTE:** The search function matches every field of the table, so you are
          not restricted to merely looking up servers by title. You may simply enter
          IP addresses, room names or even game versions to filter for specific
          games. The downside is that you may end up with a few more servers after
          filtering than you may expect.

The *fancy* browser will present you with a set of controls and a slightly
blockier list of servers. The search and sort functions work just the same
as in the fast browser, except that instead of clicking a field, you pick
the sorting criteria from one of the combo boxes.

The other combo box enables you to switch between list and gallery views.
The list view has been set as default as users have reported that it is
easier to read and faster to render, but if you wanna save some space or
have an exotic display setup (such as an ultra-wide 32:9 widescreen display
or a 4" phone screen), the gallery view may be more efficient at dealing
with screen real estate.

Once launched the fancy browser will periodically fill your screen with
more and more netgames. This is because it is capable of leveraging the
[SRB2Query] API to query information about each individual netgame,
something left out of the fast browser for added performance.  
Shall a netgame be listed but unreachable (e.g. due to an inability to
forward ports), the network failure will mark the netgame in red and make
it transparent. If you wanna retry, you can just push the update button on
that netgame again any time.
